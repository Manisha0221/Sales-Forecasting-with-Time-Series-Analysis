# Key Insights

Sales Overview:

Sales trends indicate a steady growth from 2019 to 2020, with peak sales occurring during holiday seasons.
Most orders are placed within the Office Supplies category, particularly focusing on Binders and Paper products.

Profit Analysis:
The average profit per order stands at $29.70, with significant variation across different product categories.
2020 saw a slight increase in profitability compared to 2019, potentially due to increased online shopping trends.
Notably, the highest profit recorded is $8,399.98, whereas the dataset also includes transactions resulting in losses (minimum profit: -$6,599.98).

Customer Segmentation:
The majority of the sales are from the Consumer segment, followed by Corporate and Home Office.
California emerges as the top state in terms of sales, with New York City being the leading city.
A noticeable increase in sales to the Home Office segment in 2020 reflects the shift to remote work during the pandemic.

Shipping and Order Fulfillment:
Standard Class is the most utilized shipping mode, indicating a preference for cost-effective delivery options.
Orders generally take between 2 to 7 days from order date to ship date, with a few exceptions using First Class for expedited delivery.
The pandemic in 2020 led to a slight increase in shipping delays, particularly in the early months.

Returns and Payment Mode:
Around 4.8% of transactions involve returns, with Online payments being the most common method.
An increase in returns was observed in 2020, likely due to changes in purchasing behavior during the pandemic.
